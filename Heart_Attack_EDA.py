### üîç Top 5 Insights from Heart Attack Correlation Analysis

#### 1) **Chest Pain (cp) is the strongest predictor of heart attack**
- ###### Correlation with Target: 0.43\n
- ###### Patients with chest pain are significantly more likely to have a heart attack.

#### 2) **Maximum Heart Rate (thalach) shows strong positive correlation**
- ###### Correlation with Target: 0.42\n
- ###### Higher maximum heart rate during exercise indicates higher heart attack risk.

#### 3) **Exercise-Induced Angina (exang) is a critical risk factor**
- ###### Correlation with Target: -0.44\n
- ###### Negative correlation means absence of angina lowers heart attack risk.

#### 4) **ST Depression (oldpeak) strongly predicts heart attack**
- ###### Correlation with Target: -0.43\n
- ###### Higher ST depression indicates greater heart stress and risk.

#### 5) **Number of Major Vessels (ca) is a key indicator**
- ###### Correlation with Target: -0.39\n
- ###### Fewer open vessels (higher blockage) increases heart attack risk.

#### **Bonus Insight**
- ###### Age has weaker but notable correlation (0.23)\n
- ###### While age contributes, other factors are stronger direct predictors.

### üìå Insights from Pair Plot Analysis

#### üîπ 1. **Age**
- Slightly higher age appears to be associated with heart disease (target = 1), though the overlap is substantial.
- The density plot suggests that middle-aged individuals (40‚Äì60) are more likely to be in the heart disease group.

#### üîπ 2. **Cholesterol (chol)**
- Cholesterol levels do not show a clear distinction between the two target classes.
- High variance and overlap indicate that cholesterol alone may not be a strong predictive factor in this dataset.

#### üîπ 3. **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)**
- Thalach is one of the more discriminative features.
- Individuals with **lower maximum heart rates** tend to have heart disease.
- The density plots show a clear shift: those with **higher thalach** are mostly non-diseased (target = 0).

#### üîπ 4. **Oldpeak**
- Oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest) shows good separation.
- Individuals with **higher oldpeak values** are more likely to have heart disease.
- This makes it a strong indicator for target = 1.

#### üîπ 5. **Feature Interactions**
- **thalach vs. age**: Inversely related ‚Äî older individuals tend to have lower maximum heart rate.
- **oldpeak vs. thalach**: Slight inverse trend ‚Äî higher ST depression often coincides with lower heart rate.
- Other pairings like **chol vs. age** show no significant correlation.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary
- **thalach** and **oldpeak** show the most promise as predictive features.
- **Age** adds moderate value.
- **Cholesterol** does not appear to contribute significantly to class separation in this visualization.
